## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

The main objectives of these projects are:

- To understand **digital electronics concepts** through programming
- To build strong fundamentals for **VLSI design**
- To practice implementing **logic-level behavior** using C
- To improve logical thinking and problem-solving skills
- To bridge the gap between **software logic and hardware design**

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

The projects in this repository are based on concepts such as:

- Digital logic and Boolean operations  
- Combinational circuits (e.g., adders, logic-based systems)  
- Conditional logic and control flow  
- Input–output handling  
- Looping and decision-making structures  
- Simulation of digital behavior using software  

These concepts are essential for understanding **digital circuits**, **computer architecture**, and **VLSI systems**.
